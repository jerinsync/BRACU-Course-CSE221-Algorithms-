#A counter is used to keep track if the adjacent number was swapped while comparing two numbers in the bubble sort. 
#the counter willÂ be 0 if the adjacent elements are not swapped in the inner loop, indicating the array has already been sorted. 
#Despite the array being sorted normally in bubble sort, the first loop iterates through the array. 
#So altering the code by using 'break' statement there will be no need for the first loop to traverse over the array again. 
#Therefore, in the best-case scenario, complexity is O(n) when the array has already been sorted.
